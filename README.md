--------------------

CircleTouch is an application built with the Cinder framework. The Cinder framework can be downloaded from [libcinder.org](http://libcinder.org).

Once the Cinder framework is downloaded, set the $CINDER environment variable to point to the directory where Cinder resides.

CircleTouch is supplied with a Visual Studio 2013 for Windows Desktop project file. Open the solution of project file in Visual Studio and build the game. This relies on versions of Cinder (and the boost dependency) from the latest master branch.
